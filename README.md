# Ruby Takeaway Ordering System

## Description

This is a Ruby only multiclass program that takes a user's choice of items, verifies they are on the menu, allows the order to be read back prior to ordering, then when the order is placed the user gets an automated text via the Twilio API confirming pickup time, finally they can request an itemised receipt with a grand total cost.

### Next steps

Future considerations would be to present the menu and collect user choices through a UI rather than via the add method.
